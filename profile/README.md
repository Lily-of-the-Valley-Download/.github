When his mother dies, our protagonist returns home to Wales for the first time in ten years to attend her funeral. Then, on a walk in the countryside, he encounters a mysterious young girl.  

Though her face is expressionless and her words are cold, the man soon forms a friendship with her… of sorts. However, their meetings only leave him with more questions.  

- How did she know his mother?

- Why does she look so much like his childhood sweetheart?  

But only one thing is certain: **there is much more to Lily than meets the eye.**
